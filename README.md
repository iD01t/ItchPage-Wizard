## 2) High-level reasoning summary

- We front-load quality gates and CLI parity so Hules AI and CI can exercise the app deterministically without a GUI.
- We then add batch, themes, templates to 10x creator throughput.
- We harden GIF quality and collage logic to meet tight itch targets with measurable acceptance criteria.
- We close with docs, i18n, privacy-first telemetry, and automated releases to reduce manual overhead.

## 3) Alternative options

- UI stack change: migrate PySimpleGUI to PyQt6 or a small local web UI (Tauri/FastAPI) for richer theming.
- Packaging switch: Nuitka or Briefcase for smaller, faster binaries if PyInstaller size is a concern.
- Auto-update: integrate PyUpdater or Sparkle/WinSparkle if you want in-app “Update Available”.

## 4) Practical action plan

- Commit the new `README.md` above.
- Create issues per **Step 0–12** with the acceptance criteria as checklists.
- Add two GitHub Actions: `test.yml` and `release.yml`.
- Ship **v1.1** after Steps 0–3, then iterate on 1.2 and 1.3 per roadmap.
